🧩 Exploring Chrome Extensions 🧩
=====================================

## 📌 Description

In this repository you will find a collection of Chrome browser extensions developed with the goal of learning, experimenting and providing useful solutions for everyday web browsing.

## 📂 Content

This repository is based on four main files that define the structure and behavior of each extension:

*   **`icon48.png`**: The icon that represents the extension in the browser toolbar and in the extension management page.

*   **`manifest.json`**: The central configuration file of the extension. It defines the name, description, required permissions, main script (`popup.html`) and other important metadata.

*   **`popup.html`**: The user interface that is displayed when the user clicks on the extension icon in the toolbar. It contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript necessary for user interaction.

*   **`popup.js`**: The JavaScript script that controls the logic and behavior of `popup.html`. It allows interaction with Chrome APIs, DOM manipulation and other tasks.

In addition to these main files, the repository also includes:

*   🛠️ Original extension projects and base templates.
*   💻 Commented and organized code examples to facilitate development.
*   ⚙️ Tools and utilities that improve the browser user experience.
*   📖 Brief documentation and quick guides to install and customize each extension.
